Heriot-Watt University fosters over 100 nationalities annually. Despite this, however, many nationalities remain underrepresented and encounter struggles when exposed to other nationalities because of various language barriers. The year 2020 marked Heriot-Watt University’s first International “Week”, hosted and organized by the MUN Club. The aim of such a week was to address this dire cultural situation and promote cultural inclusion.
