Welcome to the WattMUN Society of the Heriot Watt University Dubai Campus Model United Nations Club! Heriot Watt Dubai is committed to academic and extracurricular excellence and has always prioritized the interests and holistic growth of its students and has created true global citizens in the past through its various clubs. The Model United Nations Club, founded in 2013, has established a reputation in various areas both in the country and overseas and aims, in conjunction with Heriot Watt Universityâ€™s aims, to provide the student community a platform for enriching their skills to create better individuals for the future. The world we will enter after our education is a turbulent, volatile one- with global issues augmented by an unequal distribution of power and resources. In this scenario, one platform which provides a hope for peaceful and diplomatic resolution is the United Nations. By simulating the UN, we aim to allow students to discuss current world issues in a diplomatic environment, and reach an outcome of greater knowledge on politics, debating, and problem-solving approaches. We allow every student to be equally represented and heard, and to have a say in what happens next. This equips high school students and university - the future generation - to have the strength to go forth and influence the world around them.
